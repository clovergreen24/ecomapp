# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
Admin.create(email: "admin@gmail.com", password: "admin123")
# o.order_products.create(product_id: 1, size: 10, quantity: 2)
# OrderProduct.create(product_id: 3, size: "S", quantity: 2, order_id: 4)
